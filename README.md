# AI-Powered-Data-Visulatization-and-Standardization-in-Supply-Chain-
Retail supply chains are complex systems that require efficient management of inventory, pricing, and logistics. This project focuses on data-driven insights to optimize supply chain performance using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and AI-powered visualization techniques.

🚀 Features

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handles missing values and standardizes data for consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes stock levels, sales trends, and customer behavior.

Profitability Analysis: Identifies high-margin products and locations.

Demand Prediction: Examines stock utilization and sales trends.

Customer Insights: Analyzes ratings and reviews to enhance product strategies.

📊 Dataset Information

The dataset consists of:

Store_ID: Unique identifier for stores

Store_Location: City where the store is located

Product_Category: Type of product sold

Selling_Price: Price at which the product is sold

Units_Sold: Number of units sold

Stock_Level: Available inventory

Supplier_ID: Supplier information

Delivery_Time_Days: Time taken for product delivery

Customer_Reviews: Ratings provided by customers

Discount_Applied: Discount percentage on products
